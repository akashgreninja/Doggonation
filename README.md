<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>Doggonation is built using the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>React with Vite for the frontend</li>
  <li>Redux for state Management</li>
  <li>Flask for the backend API</li>
  <li>Azure MySQL for the SQL database hosting</li>
  <li>Azure App Services for hosting the backend</li>
  <li>Azure Cognitive Services for translation</li>
  <li>CI/CD using GitHub Actions</li>
</ul>


<h2>CI/CD using GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>This repository implements continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for frontend React and backend Flask code, using GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is a platform that allows for the creation of automated workflows, including continuous integration and deployment, for software development.</p>
<h2>Workflows</h2>
<p>The repository has two main workflows:</p>
<h3>1. Frontend React Workflow</h3>
<p>The workflow runs whenever a pull request is created or updated. It checks the frontend React code for linting errors and runs unit tests. If any of the tests fail, the workflow will fail and prevent merging the pull request.</p>
<h3>2. Backend Flask Workflow</h3>
<p>The workflow runs whenever a pull request is created or updated. It checks the backend Flask code for linting errors and runs unit tests. If any of the tests fail, the workflow will fail and prevent merging the pull request.</p>
<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>By using GitHub Actions, we can ensure that every pull request to the repository is automatically checked for code quality and unit tests. This means that any errors can be detected early in the development process, saving time and effort in the long run.</p>
<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
<p>Using GitHub Actions, we can also automate the deployment process for our applications. We can set up a workflow that deploys our code to a staging environment for testing and then to production once it has been approved. This ensures that our code is always up-to-date and running smoothly.</p>

## Introduction

The torchvision library is a popular computer vision library for PyTorch. It provides a set of functions and classes that can be used to easily and efficiently load and preprocess image datasets, as well as pre-trained models for image classification and object detection.

One of the pre-trained models available in torchvision is AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network that was developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton in 2012. AlexNet is known for its outstanding performance on the ImageNet dataset, and it helped to popularize deep learning in computer vision.



<p>The <code>torchvision</code> module is a collection of datasets, models, and transforms for computer vision tasks in PyTorch. One of the pre-trained models included in torchvision is AlexNet, which is a deep convolutional neural network that was introduced in 2012 and won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge that year.</p>

<p>AlexNet is designed to classify images into one of 1,000 categories, such as dogs, cats, cars, and so on. The model consists of 5 convolutional layers, 3 fully connected layers, and 1 softmax layer. The input to the model is a 224x224 RGB image.</p>

<p>In our project, we used AlexNet and torchvision to analyze input pictures and determine if they contain a dog or not. Specifically, we fine-tuned the AlexNet model on a dataset of dog images using transfer learning, which allowed us to use the pre-trained weights of the model and train only the last layer on our own dataset.</p>

<p>Using this approach, we were able to achieve high accuracy in classifying images as containing a dog or not. We then used this model to enforce a requirement that user-uploaded pictures must contain a dog in order to be accepted by our application.</p>

<p>By leveraging the power of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we were able to quickly and effectively build a solution for our image analysis needs.</p>


## Usage

To use the AlexNet model in your PyTorch project, you can simply import it from torchvision.models:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

# Load the pre-trained AlexNet model
alexnet = models.alexnet(pretrained=True)

# Set the model to evaluation mode
alexnet.eval()

# Use the model to make predictions on your data
outputs = alexnet(inputs)

```


## NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a Python library that provides various tools and resources for natural language processing (NLP). It offers easy-to-use interfaces to perform tasks such as tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, and more.

### Why NLTK?

In our project, we utilize NLTK for its powerful text processing capabilities. Specifically, we leverage NLTK to fetch the most commonly used tags from posts and display relevant posts based on those tags. By using NLTK's tokenization and part-of-speech tagging functionality, we can extract important keywords or tags from the text and analyze their frequency to determine the most common ones.

By incorporating NLTK into our project, we can enhance the user experience by providing a curated display of posts that are relevant to specific topics or tags. NLTK's comprehensive toolkit and resources make it an ideal choice for performing various NLP tasks, allowing us to extract meaningful insights from textual data.

To learn more about NLTK and explore its extensive capabilities, refer to the [NLTK documentation](https://www.nltk.org/).



## Text Speech Analysis

In this project, we performed text speech analysis using various natural language processing techniques to extract insights from textual data. We utilized tools such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition to gain a deeper understanding of the language used in our dataset.

Our sentiment analysis, as depicted in the above image, revealed a generally positive sentiment towards our product. This information can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.

<h2>Real-time Communication with Flask-SocketIO</h2>

<img src="https://socket.io/images/rooms.png">

<p>Flask-SocketIO is an extension for Flask that allows you to easily implement real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the client using Socket.IO.</p>

<p>With Flask-SocketIO, you can create applications with real-time features such as chat systems, live updates, and notifications. It provides a seamless integration of Socket.IO into your Flask application, simplifying the implementation of real-time communication.</p>

<p>Key features and advantages of Flask-SocketIO:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Real-time bidirectional communication:</strong> Flask-SocketIO enables real-time communication channels between the server and the client, allowing instant data transfer.</li>
  <li><strong>Event-driven architecture:</strong> It provides an event-driven programming model where you can define event handlers on the server and client side to handle various events, such as receiving messages or broadcasting updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Flask-SocketIO is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, making it suitable for applications with high traffic and real-time requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> It works seamlessly with Flask and integrates well with other Flask extensions and libraries, allowing you to leverage the rich Flask ecosystem.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for fallback options:</strong> Flask-SocketIO includes built-in support for fallback options, ensuring compatibility with older browsers that do not support WebSocket, by falling back to other transport mechanisms such as long-polling.</li>
</ul>

<p>To use Flask-SocketIO, you need to install the Flask-SocketIO package and import the necessary classes and functions in your Flask application. Then, you can define routes and event handlers to handle incoming socket events from the client and emit events back to the client.</p>

<p>For more details on how to use Flask-SocketIO and its various features, refer to the official <a href="https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/">Flask-SocketIO documentation</a>.</p>
